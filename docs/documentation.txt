Input: File
Output: Terminal
Variables naming: only letters
Each statement must begin with new line
Math expressions are made from operators +, -, /, * and variables, integers, float numbers
Each element from the math expression must be separated by a space
Comments start with # and free lines are acceptable
Equal sign have two roles: assign values for new or existing variables; check equality of two values in if statements


Existing instructions:
<int/float> <varname> = <math expression>
<varname> = <math expression>
show <math expression>

if <varname> = <math expression> then
    ...
endif

repeat <math expression> times
    ...
endrepeat


Possible errors:
Syntax Error: There is an if statement that is not 'closed' (unpredictable behavior may occur)"
Syntax Error: To many endif statements
Syntax Error: (on line number ...)
Division Error: You cannot divide by zero
Initialization Error: Cannot initiate one variable two times
Initialization Error: Variable was not initiated

Some errors and/or unpredictable behavior can be triggered if:
Math operator do not have 2 values to work with
Each element from the math expression is not separated by a space

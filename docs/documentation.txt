Input: File
Output: Terminal
Variables naming: only letters
Each statement must begin with new line
Math expressions are made from operators +, -, /, * and variables, integers, float numbers
Each element from the math expression must be separated by a space
Comments start with # and free lines are acceptable
Here work implicit conversion of float values to int
Equal sign have two roles: assign values for new or existing variables; check equality of two values in if statements


Existing instructions:
<int/float> <varname> = <math expression>
<varname> = <math expression>
show <math expression>

if <varname> = <math expression> then
    ...
endif

repeat <math expression> times
    ...
endrepeat


Possible errors:
Syntax Error: There are open if statements
Syntax Error: There are open loops
Syntax Error: Too many endif statements
Syntax Eror: Too many endrepeat statements
Syntax Error: (on line number ...)
Syntax Error: If statements are not allowed in loops
Division Error: You cannot divide by zero
Initialization Error: Cannot initiate one variable two times
Initialization Error: Variable was not initiated

Some errors and/or unpredictable behavior can be triggered if:
Math operator do not have 2 values to work with
Each element from the math expression is not separated by a space
If or loop statements are not closed in same scope
